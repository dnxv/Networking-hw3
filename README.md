# How to use
Run server.py
```python server.py```

Run client.py 
```python client.py```

You will be prompted the following (on Client.py):
```
Destination: 
Message:
Number times to send: 
```
Destination example: `x.x.x.x:12000`
Message example: `Hello!`
Number times example: `10`

Note: hit `Enter` after each input

Here is an example of how it can look

```
Destination: localhost:12000
Message: Howdy
Number times to send: 10
```

# Purpose of this code
The purpose of this code is to build on top of UDP by adding extra headers to create more 
reliability of ensuring messages are being sent.

# Install NetEM
```
sudo apt-get install iproute2
```

# Tests and their output
## Condition 1 (No latency or loss): Send 100 messages from client to server. 
```python client.py```
```
Destination: x.x.x.x:12000
Message: Howdy
Number times to send: 100
```
### client and server output:

## Condition 2.1 (Artificial Latency, No Loss) 
- Add enough delay time using NetEm to trigger your timeout timer and generate 
conditions for retransmission. 
```
sudo tc qdisc add dev enp7s0 root netem delay 250ms
```
### client and server output:
Note: output should show timeout and retransmissions
<insert image here>

## Condition 2.2 (No Latency, Artificial Loss) 
- Add 10% packet loss using NetEm to trigger retransmissions. 
```
sudo tc qdisc add dev enp7s0 root netem loss 10%
```

Note: Stopping Network Impairments
IMPORTANT: Please remember to disable the network impairments after tests are done:
```
sudo tc qdisc del dev enp7s0 root netem
```
### client and server output:
Note: output should show retransmissions timeout and retransmissions

def send(mesg, addr, port, seqRange):
  """
  Sends x messages to server where x is the window size. The server is connected 
  with a socket with addr and port.
  
  Returns:
    None
  Example:
    >>> mesg, addr, port, seqRange = 'Howdy', localhost, 12000, 10
    >>> send(mesg, addr, port, seqRange)
  """

def recv(batch):
  we print only if ack
  """
  receives x messages from server while batch is not empty. If the message 
  hasn't timed out, wait for the acknowledgement for each message. If we 
  receive the acknowledgement, we remove the corresponding sequence number 
  from the batch list and prints the acknowledgement + message received 
  from the server.
  
  Returns:
    None
  Example:
    >>> seqRange = range(i, batchLength) # (0, 10)
    >>> batch = list(seqRange)           # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

def main():
  """
  initiate and ask the user for destination addr:port, contents of message, 
  and total number of N times to send the message. 
  
  Iterate through total N messages by steps of size window/"batch" size (e.g. 10). 
  Most batches are the same size, and we accounted for the case where the last 
  batch is less than the window size (e.g 3 messages remaining when window/batch 
  size was 10). As we iterate, we send batches of messages and then wait to receive 
  their acknowledgements.

def encapsulate(seq, msg):
  """
  Sum up the different parts of the payload including sequence number and the
  message into a single string. This method also has a max header size of 8. 
  
  Returns:
    string: formated by any necessary padding, sequence number, and the message
  Example:
    >>> seq, msg = 0, 'Howdy'
    >>> packet = encapsulate(seq, msg)
    >>> packet
    b'    0howdy' 
    #Note the padding

def decapsulate(data):
  """
  Split up the data/packet into its respective components: 
  headers (first 8 characters) and message (anything after 8 characters). 
  Note: converting string to integers will remove any padding spaces used.
  
  Returns:
    integer, string: the first 8 characters are converted into integers and 
    the anything after the 8th character is the message
  Example:
    >>> data = '  100Howdy'
    >>> packet = decapsulate(data)
    >>> packet
